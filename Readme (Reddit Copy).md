I present to you "Explosiontastic's Extraordinary Empyrean Foundation Fully-Automatic Fractaline Moving Magic Macro" or (EFM)3 for short.

It slices, it dices, it keeps your mouse buttons safely under it's warranty of 65 million mean clicks before failure. It'll save you from the Secret Order of Occupational Therapists and Orthopaedic Surgeons that have recently infiltrated Bungie in an attempt to drive up global rates of gaming related RSI in an effort to drive referrals towards themselves, whom have no doubt architected this entire Empyrean Foundation nonsense.

Everything is mostly fully commented in the macro to explain how everything works so hopefully you read some of it before you go pulling the trigger. Some of you won't read any of this thread, or the macro comments or the following instructions. Godspeed.

   

So what does it take to be a Shen-Yun Dancer?

This handy macro linked above.

Pulover's Macro Creator running with the macro provided above loaded. (https://www.macrocreator.com/download/)

Destiny 2 set to a resolution of "1920 x 1080" and set to run in "Windowed Fullscreen” Window Mode. Other modes may not open and maximise correctly (might need you to intervene and to hit Alt-Enter after the application switch occurs before the macro runs proper to ensure Destiny 2 is full screen) and will result in buttons that aren't quite underneath where the macro co-ordinates are mapped to.

The Director - Quests tab should be "Sorted by Newest" for the same reason as above.

A key mapping for "Open Director - Quests", the macro is currently mapped to "k", feel free to change this in the macro to whatever you like, but they must both be set to the same identity or the macro will never turn in bounties but will continue to spend your Fractaline.

An empty postmaster (21 spots) + 4/5 empty spots for whatever weapon type you're creating. 4 weapons per loop, current default number of loops is 5. (Personally I've been running 6 loops for 3.3333 full macroed loops, requires intervention to stop the macro on last pass)

Between 240,001 and 242,999 glimmer. This should give you 4 full loops x 20 weapons for 80 weapons baked between Spider runs.

An incomplete bounty from any vendor that won't expire anytime soon, to act as a barrier so your saved bounties aren't accidentally turned in.

You MUST inspect the macro and select/de-select the Obelisk and weapon groups that correspond to what you wish to begin purchasing.

For the Obelisk 2nd or 3rd Tab selection you may highlight everything (coloured Green/Purple) then "Right Click -> Select -> Invert checks" to switch between weapons on the Second or Third Obelisk tab. (For whatever reason if I add a group above this, it eats all the other groups ¯_(ツ)_/¯ I tried to label it better, truly.)

For the weapon selection, you will need to find the relevant weapon group and check ALL of the boxes left of the instructions, and de-select all of the checkboxes inside of whatever weapon group the macro was previously set to use. Some weapons share button co-ordinates with another in the opposite tab, the Obelisk choice outlined above will determine what frame is produced. The weapon listed first is on the second obelisk tab, the weapon listed second is on the thrid obelisk tab.

VERY IMPORTANT You must be interacting with the Obelisk and have collected/dismissed when prompted for your weekly Fractaline Harvest AT THE START OF EACH AND EVERY MACRO ACTIVATION FROM WITHIN PULOVER.

A kitchen timer set for roughly 4:20 seconds to remind you when a batch of weapons are fully baked and you need to clear out your Postmaster. A timer that keeps the time you set for it rather than resetting itself back to 0 is optimal.

Some thumbs to twiddle while everything runs in the background. As in you won't be using your current computer to do anything else while this runs. You might be able to watch something on multi-monitor setup, but I've no idea if the macro will run correctly in the Destiny 2 window open as you'd expect it to or do... something unexpected...?

???????

Profit!!!!!!

     

Now you've blasted through all of your glimmer, melted everything but the good shit what to do next?
 

Try the handy included Spider Materials Autobuy Macro to stock up on materials.
 

Need to mass buy glimmer? Logitech/Corsair Mouse? Make a new macro in the Corsair/Logitech Gaming software with the following instructions bound to your 5/6/37th mouse button:

HELP! THIS ISN'T WORKING PROPERLY! WHAT DO I DO?
 

Don't Panic
 

Try some Codeine-Phosphate for your headache.

Seriously though, Lag sometimes affects your ability to make purchases from vendors or when turning in bounties, which will mess with timing of this macro, causing it to miss or skip things. Strongly consider running the Destiny 2 Solo Windows Powershell script. Apart from the fact loading into the tower/tangled shore is much quicker, I've done little to no testing while in shared spaces... so there's that.

HELP HOW DO I STOP IT?
The dumb way is by Alt-Tabbing back to Pulover. The Smart Way would have been to set/check the Stop / Pause key in Pulover. It should be on the upper right area of the screen near where you minimise/maximise/close the application. For me it's F8. I literally have no clue if the shorcut is tied to the macro or installed application. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ i use the dumb

Nothing is getting done, or rather you're watching the macro attempt to do work but purchases/donations are only getting half done.
STOP DOING SPEED. SERIOUSLY. You probably bumped a shortcut key and Pulover has been set to x2 Speed. Just like in real life too much speed will lead to nothing getting done. "Drugs are bad, mmmkay?"

Everything works fine until after the Fractlaine has been donated, what's wrong?
Did you RTFM? Seriously? It did tell you to set a key mapping for your "Open Director - Quests" tab. Go do that.

The Macro is running, the mouse is moving but button clicks aren't registering on anything or appear to be occurring next to/over/under where buttons actually are.
Have you set the monitors resolution set to "1920x1080"? Is Destiny 2 running "Windowed Fullscreen" mode? Is it fully maximised window with no border? The macro doesn't actually know where the buttons in Destiny 2 are, it relies solely on the co-ordinates syncing up with where the buttons are expected to be on a fully maximised 1920x1080 screen.

The Macro is doing something, but on the wrong screen? It accidentally deleted system32.exe? Did I need that?
This macro was made on a machine where Destiny 2 was running on the only display. No that's not some kind of peasant joke you're too rich to understand, some of us really only have 1 monitor. I've seriously no fucking clue how it'll react to multi-monitor setups or what delightful chaos it might otherwise cause if Destiny 2 isn't running on whatever monitor is tiled first in Windows settings. Check the comments for victims beta-testers to report first.

Monitor resolution of 1920x1080 is too high for you?
You're in no mans land. Likely all the macro co-ordinates will be off by an increasing amount or simply be offscreen when it attmpets to run. I'd advise against running the macro. If you're keen you could map out new co-ordinates to use, and use the macro as provided as a base to create a new one. As above you should check the comments for victims beta-testers to report first.

THE TIMINGS ARE ALL OFF! EVERYTHING ONLY GETS PART DONE! OH GOD HELP!
This might be a result of the speed of your machine vs the machine I created it on. You'll probably have to play with the timings and pauses between events and slow things down. I can't really help you much there, but maybe another user has already made alterations and posted it. Alternatively try the Codeine-Phosphate authored Powershell script linked above.

OH GOD, BUT I'M ON XBONE/PS4!
Enjoy your gnarled, bleeding and arthritic, claw like hands

OH GOD IT ACCIDENTALLY COLLECTED MY WEEKLY FRACTALINE! I WASN'T READDDDD-EEEEEE-HHHHEEEE!!!!!!!!!
 

I TOLD YOU MAN
I TOLD YOU ABOUT STAIRS!
 

OH GOD WHY DIDN'T YOU POST THIS SOONER?!?!?! MY HANDS!!!!! MY PRECIOUS HANDS!!!!!!
I was being hunted by the aforementioned Secret Order of Occupational Therapists and Orthopaedic Surgeons after I discovered their plans and had to find a place of safety. Or Procrastination. Pick one.

   

Disclaimer: This macro is provided absolutely free and without any guarantees. Use at your own risk.
 

I've no idea if something wholly unexpected could happen and bork your beloved battlestaion/pc/potato or push all your god roll raid gear sitting in your postmaster because you've no more vault space cause all you did was download the macro and pull the trigger without reading through anything or setting it up correctly. I've no idea if Bungie could suddenly decide they want to start cracking down or banning people suspected of 3rd Party Tool use. Bungie does not appear to consider macro use for the purposes outlined above a bannable offence. See here: (https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/255149330?sort=0&page=0&path=1) "Automating trivial tasks (especially for accessibility reasons) is allowed. Players will only punished for automation when it circumvents challenges all players face during gameplay (auto-aim, trigger-bot, etc)."

   

Lastly if you appreciate what I've put together and wish to show some appreciation, consider making a donation to the Apostrophe Protection Society(http://www.apostrophe.org.uk/), the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (http://www.vhemt.org/) or The Human Fund on my behalf.

Alternatively you could drop a few motes to your nearest Drifter or consider an ongoing donation of just 15 glimmer a day you could sponsor a young Titan and provide them with the 12 pack of assorted Crayons they need to consume each day to maintain their blueberry status, or 50 glimmer a day for a bulk pack of 72 crayons, enough for a full fire team.

 

Seriously though, if you benefit from this macro, you use it, wished you'd used it, draw inspiration from it, re-purpose it, PLEASE TELL OTHERS about it. Share it, give it to clan mates, give it people on discord, tell people in the tower, give it people on discord, your mum, your dog. Whoever. SAVE. THEIR. HANDS.

 

And now... Sleep.

Edit: For anybody curious as to why this macro came so late, I have 200200 Obelisk Resonance and have only just started spending last weeks Fractaline Harvest. After 5-6 hours of testing, and 7-8 hours of the macro running yesterday and I've still 110,000 Fractaline left to spend. I'm betting that there are probably others in a similar situation.

Edit 2: Duplicated here for mods: Bungie does not appear to consider macro use for the purposes outlined above a bannable offence. See here: (https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/255149330?sort=0&page=0&path=1) "Automating trivial tasks (especially for accessibility reasons) is allowed. Players will only punished for automation when it circumvents challenges all players face during gameplay (auto-aim, trigger-bot, etc)."
